# Structure-Based Discovery of Non-Covalent Triazole-Based Cruzipain Inhibitors with Improved Bioactivity Translation.

## Repository description:

In this repository, the source datafiles and Python scripts used as part of the scientific research reported in the manuscript are included.

The corresponding data is organized as part of the following folders:

`Database`: this folder contains a database (.db file) that includes the SMILES, inchi keys and properties of the filtered building blocks and triazole derivatives virtually synthesised, screened and analysed. 

`Receptor-grids`: this folder contains the receptor files as used in the molecular docking assays with AutoDock-GPU.

`Ligands`: this folder contains the .pdbqt structures, parameter/topology (.prmtop) and coordinate (.inpcrd) files of of the hit compounds, required to perform docking studies and MM-MD simulations.

`Python_scripts`: this folder contains general Python scripts used during the virtual screening workflow, including molecular docking, MM-MD and MMPBSA studies.
